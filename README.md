Object = something in Java script that contains data, a way of organising code.

Class = template for declaring a creating objects.

I stated by experimenting with the point function and I noticed how organic the shapes looked. I first had the idea to make an abstract sketch of flowers growing. However after trying out other things and altering the direction the points, I decided to create a sketch of water. Using different shades of blue and showing the movement/flow of water.
